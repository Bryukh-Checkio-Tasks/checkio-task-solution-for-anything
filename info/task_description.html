<p>
    Try to make a solution which is passed in any case.
    The result of your function should return True for any comparison with anything.
</p>

<p>
    You should write function "checkio" which are called with one argument and result will be
    compared with some data (==, !=, etc) and the result of this comparison should be True.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Who knows as some data.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The something as a something.
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio({}) != [] # True
checkio('Hello') < 'World' # True
checkio(80) > 81 # True
checkio(re) >= re # True
checkio(re) <= math # True
checkio(5) == ord # True
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task will show you how to use Python "magic" (sorry for the spoiler).
